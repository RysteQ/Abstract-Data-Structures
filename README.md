# Simple Abstract Data Types

---

This repository contains two, very simple, [abstract data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type). These two ADT's are the most **basic** (in my opinion) ADT's out there that everyone should know how they, at the very least, work.

#### Those abstract data types are:

* [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
* [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

**I have included the programs for the ADT's written in the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).*

## Notes

I will most likely **not** add [binary trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) or [linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) to this repository, that's not to say that those data structures are useless, in fact, I encourage you to read about them, I just don't want to bother coding them in all honesty.
